    <b>Figure 1:</b> T. Rex with 2694 faces rendered with Ptex.  No explicit
UV assignment was used.  The largest texture layer, the fine-scale
displacements, has 836 million texels stored in a single Ptex file
with individual face resolutions ranging from 64 x 64 to
2048 x 2048 texels.  No seams are visible across faces, even
under close magnification. (Â©Walt Disney Animation Studios)

<h3>Abstract:</h3>
Explicit parameterization of subdivision surfaces for texture mapping
adds significant cost and complexity to film production.  Most
parameterization methods currently in use require setup effort, and
none are completely general.  We propose a new texture mapping method
for Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces that requires no explicit
parameterization. Our method, <i>Ptex</i>, stores a separate
texture per quad face of the subdivision control mesh, along with a
novel per-face adjacency map, in a single texture file per
surface. Ptex uses the adjacency data to perform seamless anisotropic
filtering of multi-resolution textures across surfaces of arbitrary
topology. Just as importantly, Ptex requires no manual setup and
scales to models of arbitrary mesh complexity and texture detail.

Ptex has been successfully used to texture all of the models in an
animated theatrical short and is currently being applied to an entire
animated feature.  Ptex has eliminated UV assignment from our studio
and significantly increased the efficiency of our pipeline.
